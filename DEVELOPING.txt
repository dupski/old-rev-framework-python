Getting Started with RevFramework development using Eclipse
-----------------------------------------------------------

1. Download Eclipse Luna from eclipse.org

 I recommend the 'Eclipse for PHP Developers' distribution as it is pretty small
 and contains the basic tools needed for web development

2. Install the Nodeclipse plugins
 
 Use the 'Installation/Upgrade Instructions'
 from http://www.nodeclipse.org/updates/

3. Start your project!
