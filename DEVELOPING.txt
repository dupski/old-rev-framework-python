Getting Started with RevFramework development using Eclipse
-----------------------------------------------------------

1. Download Eclipse Luna from eclipse.org

 I recommend the 'Eclipse for PHP Developers' distribution as it is pretty small
 and contains the basic tools needed for web development

2. Install the PyDev plugins
 
 Use the 'Installation with Update Site' instructions from:
 http://pydev.org/manual_101_install.html

3. Start your project!
