Rev Rapid Application Development Framework
===========================================

Rev is a rapid application development framework designed to simplify creation
of data-driven apps for Mobile, Desktop and the Web.

This project is currently in pre-alpha stages.

The features of the framework are intended to be:

 * Powerful Module System with dependency resolution
 
 * Easy-to-use Object Relational Mapper and object registry
 
 * Modules can override any features of other modules, including modifying
   the schema of existing models, overridding controller logic and extending
   or replacing views
 
 * No faffing about with database migration files!
 
 * Simple HTTP endpoint creation with integrated template engine
 
 * Abstracted data view creation with client and server-side validation of data
   with minimal code
